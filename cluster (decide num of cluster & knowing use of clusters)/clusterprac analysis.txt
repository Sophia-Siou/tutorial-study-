steps:
1. read data (two cols && numeric vals only)
2. using elbow method to determine the number of 
    clusters needed (=4)
3. fit scaled x to predict
4. plot cols (predicted x and y)

analysis of the graph
quadrant I: high loyal && high satis- named fans
quadrant II: high loyal && low satis- named supporters
III : low loyal && low satis- named allienated
IV : low loyal && high satis- in between
